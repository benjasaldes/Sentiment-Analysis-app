# Sentiment-Analysis-app

This project is an experiment to test Streamlit. This library allows you to create web apps with your python machine learning projects.

In this case I built a Sentiment Analysis app which tells you if a given 'Tweet' is positive or negative. 

I used Logistic Regression as the model for this prediction. It showed fairly good metrics when tested.

An important limitation of this project is the amount of data used for training the model. It was a file with only 30.000 tweets. They were already classified into Positive/Negative so I just had to make a proper preprocessing for all the data (cleaning tweets so I end up having vectorized words to process).

I plan on upgrading this project every now and then, so I can test different features in Streamlit and also learn how to properly use github. For now, I don't intend on uploading this project into the web. It is just a test project.
